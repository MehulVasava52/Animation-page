About project:

I had done 2d and 3d rotation animation. For pointing object towards mouse pointer, I found digree between mouse pointer and object(at Y axies).
For the hover effact, on hover of menu items the background of body and corn image will be changed. On click of the menu item, menu item will bounce and corn image will rotate to it's original position and clicked menu item's color will be changed.
When the curser goes out of menu item then corn will start pointing towards mouse pointer again.

Libraries and Function used:

for the bounce of menu item text, I had used animate.css.
for rotation css used: rotate(x deg) , for 3d rotation rotateY(x deg).
for finding digree between positive x-axies and mouse pointer, Math.atan2()
for Dom manupulation I had used JQuery
